This website is for my home farm in Kilkenny Ireland. In this farm we sell pedigree hereford "stock bulls" to other farmers.
  -Please note Stock bulls are essentially the studs of the cattle world.
  -Herefords are a breed of cattle.

The main purpose of this website is to attract buyers. I while try to do this in three ways.
  -Display the rich history a quality of our farm
  -Display information about the "herd sires", which are all the stock bull that we use currently and in the Past
  -advertise past sales (elite genetics production sale)

The Website is comprised of 4 HTML pages and a CSS file which is derived from a SCSS file.
