              Balleen herefords
              <small class="text-muted">Founded 1932</small>

              Owners Tom & Nuala Brennan & Family
            </p>
            <p>
              The Balleen Herd was founded by the Grandfather of the present owner. Also called Tom his first purchase was a heifer Rosegold, bred by Vice Admiral A Craig Waller out of Red Rose by Shrine Courtier. Her first calf was Balleen Gold by Neuadd Scholar. For many years dairying was the main enterprise on the farm, however Herefords still constituted a very important part of the overall farm management and output system.
              <p />
              <p>
              The record of the Balleen Herd since its foundation is formidable. Firstly under the management of Toms' Grandfather then his late father Geoff and now with the assistance of his family the Balleen herd has produced a string of successes particularly on home ground in Kilkenny with regular Championships and top prices.
              <p />
              <p>
              The Herd has also won coveted awards at Society sales including the Premier Sale at Roscommon. The National Hereford Show at Tullamore has also been a happy hunting ground with several awards including the National Bull Calf Championship and the National Heifer Calf Championship.
              <p />
              <p>
              Tom has served as a member of the Society Council as its Chairman and as President. He has served on various committees including the Breed Improvement Sub Committee representing the purchasing panel in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
              <p />
              <p>
              Since his retirement from Council Tom has concentrated on his beef enterprise and the consolidation of his Hereford Herd.
              <p />
              <p>
              With his knowledge of the beef business and experience of slaughtering animals produced in his beef enterprise he was in a position to provide a valuable insight into the beef business when he served  as a member of the Board of Irish Hereford Prime and for a time as its Chairman.
